# Install & Start

#### Install nodejs

First, check if you already have node and npm installed. To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

To confirm that you have npm installed you can run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm -v
```

If node is not installed on your machine, you can go to the official nodejs.org website, and choose the version depending on your operating system:

#### Check the npm version

npm is a separate project from Node.js, and tends to update more frequently. As a result, even if youâ€™ve just downloaded Node.js (and therefore npm), youâ€™ll probably need to update your npm. Luckily, npm knows how to update itself! To update your npm, type this into your terminal:

```bash
npm install --global npm@latest
```

### Features

## Build prod

```bash
yarn build
```

#### Installing Yarn (recommended)

i personally recommend Yarn as we it is a better package manager than npm. If you want to use Yarn, keep in mind that you should not mix the 2. You either use Yarn or Npm in a project, never both.

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies installation

To configure and start installing project dependencies, run one of the following
commands:

```bash
# using npm v7
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# using yarn
yarn install
```

## ðŸ”ƒ Run a development server

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# using npm v7
npm run dev

# using yarn
yarn dev
```
